Try to keep regular brushing as a top priority.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Smoking tobacco</strong>: Tobacco smoke causes stained teeth and a wide range of other dangerous health issues. Nicotine stains are typically yellow stains with an orange hue &ndash; and can occur on the front and back of the teeth.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Drinking coffee</strong>: Coffee lovers are well-aware of how that morning cup of coffee can put some pep in your step, but it can also cause brown stains after drinking. Coffee stains are one of the most common teeth stain issues.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Drinking tea</strong>: Tea stains are extremely common and people have less awareness of them in comparison to coffee, black teas are particularly troublesome for leaving stains. Fruit or green tea can stain your teeth too!</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Drinking red wine</strong>: Red wine can easily cause dark, reddish stains on your teeth. Red wine, and other forms of alcohol, work very similarly to sugar in terms of their effects on your teeth &ndash; so wines will stick to your teeth closely.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Older age</strong>: Teeth are fully formed at a relatively early age, and tooth enamel naturally wears away as you get older.

Better cleaning and hygiene habits are also helpful for reducing the chances of developing black tartar.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Consider alternative strategies</strong>: You can avoid problem foods and drinks altogether but then again it is entirely possible to find alternatives or ways around staining foods. You can try using a straw or switching from coffee to an alternative caffeine drink. Red wine fans can consider a switch to white.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Carry gum or mints</strong>: Chewing gum and strong mints can help to clean the stains from your teeth and also give you fresher breath. Adding a small pack of mints or gum to your pocket or bag will mean that you are ready to tackle the problem of stained teeth in a problematic situation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Restorative treatments</strong>: For stained teeth that result from tooth decay,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hovedentalclinic.co.uk/restorative/\"><strong>restorative dentistry</strong></a>&nbsp;may be the best option. Options include white coloured fillings, tooth extraction and root canal treatments. This treatment can be uncomfortable but will not be painful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the most badly stained teeth can benefit from a professional cleaning by a dentist. Using special tools to remove plaque and tartar can help to improve the appearance of teeth, particularly for yellow stains.

Cavities form when acids in the mouth wear down, or erode, a tooth&rsquo;s hard outer layer (enamel). Anyone can get a cavity. Proper brushing, flossing and dental cleanings can prevent cavities (sometimes called dental caries).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How common are cavities?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 80% of Americans have at least one cavity by the time they enter their mid-30s. Cavities are one of the most common chronic diseases that affect all ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who might get a cavity?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tooth decay can happen at any age, although cavities are more common in children. They may not brush properly and consume more sugary foods and drinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adults also get cavities. Sometimes, new decay develops around the edges of cavities treated in childhood. Adults also are more likely to have receding gums. This condition exposes the lower parts of teeth to cavity-causing plaque.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the types of cavities?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tooth decay can affect all layers of a tooth. It can take three years for a cavity to form in the strong outer layer of tooth enamel. Decay progresses more quickly through the dentin (middle layer) to pulp (innermost layer). Pulp contains a tooth&rsquo;s nerve endings and blood supply. Types of tooth decay include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Smooth surface:&nbsp;</strong>This slow-growing cavity dissolves tooth enamel. You can prevent it &mdash; and sometimes reverse it &mdash; with proper brushing, flossing and dental cleanings. People in their 20s often develop this form of tooth decay between their teeth.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Pit and fissure decay:&nbsp;</strong>Cavities form on the top part of the tooth&rsquo;s chewing surface. Decay also can affect the front side of back teeth. Pit and fissure decay tends to start during the teenage years and progresses quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Root decay:</strong>&nbsp;Older adults who have receding gums are more prone to root decay. Gum recession exposes the tooth&rsquo;s root to plaque and acid. Root decay is difficult to prevent and treat.</li>\r\n</ul>', '1658901142.jpg', '1658901142.jpg', 12, 1, 0, '2022-07-26 22:52:22', NULL),

These steps typically occur:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bacteria in the mouth feed on sugary, starchy foods and drinks (fruit, candy, bread, cereal, sodas, juice and milk). The bacteria convert these carbohydrates into acids.</li>\r\n	<li>Bacteria, acid, food and saliva mix to form plaque. This sticky substance coats the teeth.</li>\r\n	<li>Without proper brushing and flossing, acids in plaque dissolve tooth enamel, creating cavities, or holes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the risk factors for cavities?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain factors increase your risk of cavities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Conditions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4929-sj%C3%B6grens-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Sjogren&rsquo;s syndrome</a>, or medications like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/9301-depression-medicines\" target=\"_blank\">antidepressants</a>, that cause dry mouth.</li>\r\n	<li>Consuming sugary, starchy foods or drinks and snacking between meals.</li>\r\n	<li>Family history of cavities.</li>\r\n	<li>Previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16192-head-and-neck-cancer-radiation-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">radiation therapy to treat head and neck cancer</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>Receding gums.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the signs of cavities?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tooth decay on the outer enamel surface doesn&rsquo;t usually cause pain or symptoms.
